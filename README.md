# ImageFilter
This is a simple app that uses opencv to apply a few basic image filters i was tinkering with. The transformations interpolate between given RGB anchors with a spline curve. The code is very flexible. Largely adapted from this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4L38sc_e6Q and the deployed as a flask app on google cloud app engine. You can try it out at https://simple-image-filter.uk.r.appspot.com/
